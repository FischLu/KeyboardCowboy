3.1.0

✨We are excited to announce that starting from this version, users can now use the "check for updates" feature to easily download new releases. This means that users will no longer have to manually search for and download new releases, as the process is now automated. We hope that this improvement will enhance the user experience and make it easier for users to stay up-to-date with the latest version of our software.

To achieve this automation, we utilize the Sparkle.framework to check for updates and download new releases seamlessly.

We have also made some performance improvements under the hood for critical components.

Hope you like it! ❤️
